    "description": "A nano-cell constructed robot from the Pegasus galaxy. Pegasus Replicators differ from milky-way replicators in the way that they still take on human form. They can manipulate the bonds between their nano-cells to phase through materials and mitigate most damage, given they have the energy for it."
